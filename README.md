## Habit Tracker for Object Oriented and Functional Programming with Python (DLBDSOOFPP01)
A python habit tracker command-line application that uses `questionary` for a better UX and `SQLite` as database.

## Purpose
The habit tracker provides users with a simple easy tool that can be run on any platform that has access to python 3.
For compatibility reasons and keeping the appliciation lightweight the choice was made to serve it within the command-line interface which is even available on operating systems that do not have a graphical user interface.

Users can easily track their habits by creating or logging in to their own user-profile and then proceed to create, manage and view their habits in an organized and accessible manner. In this way it is easy to keep track of personal progress with the use of analytics that show habit streaks, best performing and worst performing, and more.
